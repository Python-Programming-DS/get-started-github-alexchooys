## About Me

Hi! My name is Yuanaseng, and I'm a graduate student majoring in Applied Data Science in the Engineering Education Department at the University of Florida. I'm looking forward to improve my Python coding skills and learn how to apply machine learning models with real datasets. One of my favorite hobbies is playing badminton.
